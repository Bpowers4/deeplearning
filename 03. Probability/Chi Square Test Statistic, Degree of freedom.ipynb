    "A chi square (χ2) statistic is a test that measures how expectations compare to actual observed data (or model results). The data used in calculating a chi square statistic must be random, raw, mutually exclusive, drawn from independent variables, and drawn from a large enough sample. For example, the results of tossing a coin 100 times meet these criteria.\n"
